For each medication present in the input, print out as many of these as you can find:
the name of the medication
the dosage of the medication
the duration it is being taken for
in what form it needs to be taken
and the reason it was given.
If you can't find one of these, print out "nm" after the "=>".
If you can't find any medications at all, print out "No Medications".
For example, for the sentence:
